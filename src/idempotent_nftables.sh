# This reads all .nft files in a given directory and
# idempotently applies or removes their nftables rules.
# To be used as a systemd service (start/reload/stop).
#
# Basic idea: for each file, extract the table names and
#   - remove the tables (without error if they don't exist)
#   - if 'start' or 'reload', apply the file with `nft -f`
#
# We also record the created tables in a temporary file,
# so we don't forget to clean them on reload|stop even if the
# .nft files are changed.
#
# Caveat: be careful to use unique table names in the .nft
# files, or else we'll delete tables used by others.
